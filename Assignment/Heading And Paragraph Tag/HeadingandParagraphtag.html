    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>

    <p>

        HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating web pages and structuring content on the web. It uses tags and elements to define the layout and structure of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links, which are then interpreted by web browsers to be displayed. While HTML provides the structure, technologies like CSS handle styling and JavaScript adds interactivity.

    CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS is responsible for its visual styling and layout.
