        Tanah Lot is one of the seven main Balinese "sea temples", located along the southwestern coast of the island. The name means "land [in the] sea" in the Balinese language.The main deity of the temple is Dewa Baruna, or Bhatara Segara, the sea god, or sea power.

       Tanah Lot is claimed to be the work of the 16th-century religious figure Dang Hyang Nirartha, who was significantly influenced by Hinduism and who allegedly spent a night there in the course of his extensive travels in Bali, Lombok, and Sumbawa. Nirartha is also worshipped at Tanah Lot.
